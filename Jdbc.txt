Q1. What is JDBC ?
Ans --> Jdbc is API or the Process of connecting the application and Database
            
            JDBC
Application --------------> MySQL(Database) 

JDBC API(Java Application,JDBC driver)  --------> Database.
                      \
## JDBC APi contains Java Application and JDBC Driver.


# Steps to connecting the application and Database

1. Load driver class
2. Obtain a connection
3. Obtain a statement
4. Execute the query
5. Close the connection

################################
Basic query
################################

create --> Create Table students(rollno int(3),name varchar(20));
Insert --> insert into students(rollno,name) from VALUES(1,"Ram");
Update ---> UPDATE students SET name = "shivam" WHERE roll = 1;
Delete ---> Delete from students WHERE rollno = 1;
Read All --> Select * from students;




//////////////////////////////////
How to close the connection?

Ans--> 
To close the ResultSet,

refResultSet.close();

To close the Statement

refStatement.close();

To close the connection

refConnection.close();

Q4. What is JDBC Driver?

Ans--> JDBC driver are the software components which implement Interfaces in 
JDBC APIs to enable java application to interact with the databases.

# There are four types of JDBC driver-->

1. Type -1 driver or JDBC-ODBC bridge driver
2. Type -2 driver or Native - API driver
3. Type -3 driver or Network Protocol driver
4. Type -4 driver or Thin Driver

## Which driver to use When?

1. If you are accessing one type of database,such as Oracle,Sybase,IBM,the preferred
driver is Type-4 (Thin Driver)

2. If your Java application is accessing multiple types of databases at the same
time type-3 (Network Protocol Driver)

3. %%% Type -1 is used for development and testing purpose only

4. Type 2 are useful where Type 3 and Type 4 are not available.

##################################
execute() --> it is used for all types of sql statements that return 
boolean values true or false

executeUpdate() --> it is used for DML statements(insert,update,delete)


executeQuery() ----> it is used to retrieve data from database using Select executeQuery
